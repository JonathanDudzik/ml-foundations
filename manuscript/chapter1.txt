# Mathematics with Python for ML Foundations!

# Exponents
## Basic Concept
There are times when we must multiply a number by itself multiple times. We could do something like this:

`2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2`$

But this can be a tedious way to show such an expression and hard to track how many times it is getting multiplied. Instead, we use exponents to show how many times to multiply a number. Here is an example of exponential notation:

`a^{n}`$

In this exponential notation, the variable `a`$ is called the base and the variable `n`$ is called the exponent. The exponent represents the number of times to multiply the base by itself. We can evaluate the exponential notation when the two variables are replaced with a number like this:

`2^{6}`$

In this example the number two is the base and the number six is the exponent. To solve this, we need to multiply the number two six times.

## Python Implementation
Python’s standard library supports exponents. We can easily solve exponential problems with Python using the exponentiation operator. Here are a few examples:

`\text{Evaluate}\ a^n\ \text{when}\ a = 5,\ n = 4`$

This one can be solved like this:

```python
a = 5
n = 4
answer = a ** n
print("5^4 =", answer)

# Expected output: 
# 5^4 = 625
```

`\text{Evaluate}\ -a^{a}\ \text{when}\ a=4,\ n=2`$

Be careful with this one because the negative sign before the base means the answer will be negative:
```python
a = 4
n = 2
answer = -a ** n
print("-5^4 =", answer)

# Expected output: 
# -5^4 = -16
```

`\text{Evaluate}\ (-a)^{n}\ when\ a=2,\ n=3`$

Inside parentheses, the negative sign means that each multiplication will be carried out on a negative base. Just keep in mind that a negative number raised to an odd power is always a negative answer:

```python
a = 2
n = 3
answer = (-a) ** n
print("(-2)^3 =", answer)

# Expected output: 
# (-2)^3 = -8
```

`\text{Evaluate}\ (-a)^{n}\ when\ a=3,\ n=4`$

This is similar to the previous example. Just keep in mind that a negative number raised to an even power is always a positive answer:
```python
a = 3
n = 4
answer = (-a) ** n
print("(-3)^4 =", answer)

# Expected output: 
# (-3)^4 = 81
```

# Order of Operations
## Basic Concept
We must have a way of correctly sequencing calculations when an expression contains multiple operations. Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values.

The order of operations is a set of rules used to clarify the order in which mathematical operations should be performed in an expression. Generally, the order of operations is executed left to right on parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, in that order. Order of operations is also known as the "PEMDAS" rule. Can you see why?

There are three things to keep in mind:
1.  Multiplication and division are of equal priority as long as they are solved left to right.
2.  The same is true for addition and subtraction: their priority is the same.
3.  When there are multiple grouping symbols, we simplify the innermost parentheses first and work outward.

## Python Implementation 
Python follows the order of operations for all of its mathematical operations.

`\text{Simplify}\ 5 + 23 + 3[6 -3(4\times2)]`$

To simplify an expression means to do all the math possible, using the order of operations. Here is how we can simplify this expression in Python:

```python
answer = 10 + 1 + 6 / 2 * (3 - 1)
print(answer)

# Expected output:
# Simplifying 10 + 1 + 6 / 2 * (3 - 1) equals 17.0
```

# Plotting Points and Intervals on the Number Line
## Basic Concept
In this section, we will explore a basic number line and the steps to plot points and intervals on a number line.

A number line is just a horizontal line that is used to display all the possible outcomes. It is similar to a ruler in that it helps us describe and compare numbers. We get to choose the scale of the number line and where the center is. For example, we might decide that we only need to show the numbers 70 through 90 where 80 would be the center of our number line. Typically however, number lines have zero at their center with positive numbers to the right of the zero and negative number to the left of the zero.

To create a number line with a scale of -3 to 3, simply draw a horizontal line, mark 0 as the center, and label the numbers -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 from left to right:

![number line without points](num-line-1.png)

To plot a point, for example -2.5, we first have to understand that -2.5 is between -2 and -3. We can then put a circle on the number line that is halfway between those two numbers:

![number line with one point at -2.5](num-line-2.png)

Keep in mind that their may be times when we need to plot multiple points on a single number line:

![number line with multiple points](num-line-3.png)

## Python Implementation
Python’s standard library may not support the number line as a visualization, but matlotlib does make it possible to create a number line with points. The following Python code will generate a number line, add some points and save an image of the number line to the current directory as a file named num-line.png:

```python
# import the parts of the matplotlib library we need
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def  setup(ax):
	"""Set up common parameters for the Axes"""

	# Only show the bottom spine.
	# You can think of a spine as an edge or border.
	ax.spines[['left', 'right', 'top']].set_visible(False)

	# Make the ticks for the y-axis null.
	# This next line of code essentially removes
	# the ticks for the y-axis.
	ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.NullLocator())

	# Make the ticks for the x-axis 1 inch apart.
	ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))

	# Define the tick styles.
	ax.tick_params(which='major', width=1.00, length=5)

	# Define number line range.
	ax.set_xlim(-3, 3)
	ax.set_ylim(0, 1)

# Create an empty figure with no axes.
# Make the figure 6 inches wide and 4 inches high.
plt.figure(figsize=(6.0, 4.0))

# Add and center an axis inside the image.
# The first parameter is the number of rows.
# The second parameter is the number of columns.
# The third parameter is an index for grid placement.
ax = plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)

# Give that axis the common parameters 
# from the setup function.
setup(ax)

# Create the points on the number line.
# Each point in defined by a set of two numbers.
# For each set, the first number is the x-axis position
# and the second number is the y-axis position.
ax.plot(
	-1, 0.1, 
	0, 0.1, 
	1.5, 0.1, 
	2, 0.1, 
	color='tab:blue', 
	marker='o'
)

# Save an image of the number line
plt.savefig("num-line.png")
```

# Expressing Inequalities
## Basic Concept
An inequality is used to express that one value is greater than or less than some other value (and possibly also equal to the other value). Solutions to inequalities, that is numbers that make the equation true, are infinite.

We have three forms of expressing the infinite nature of possible solutions to an inequality: The number line, set-builder notation, and interval notation. In this lesson, we will look at the number line method first and then look at the interval method. We won’t study set-builder notation, but it is very close to what you have probably already seen in many textbooks to express inequalities: Set-builder notation looks similar to `x >3`$ or `x \leq 4`$

To express all solutions to an inequality graphically, draw a number line and shade in all the values that are solutions to the inequality. Here are a couple examples:

`\text{Express the inequality, x is greater than -1 on a number line}`$

We graph the solutions to the above inequality on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of -1 to show that all numbers greater than -1 are solutions. Because the number -1 itself is not included in the solution, we use an open dot on the number line at -1:

![number line showing x greater than -1](num-line-4.png)

`\text{Express the inequality, x is less than or equal to 2 on a number line}`$

Graphing the above inequality is similar to graphing “x is greater than -1”. However we need to do two things differently this time: First we need to shade the number line in the negative direction and second we need to show that 2 is included in the solution by using a closed dot on the number line:

![number line showing x less than or equal to 2](num-line-5.png)

## Expressing inequalities with interval notation

In addition to using the number line, we can use interval notation to express the solutions to an inequality. For example, the inequality “x is greater than 3” can be expressed in the interval notation shown here: `(x, \infty)`$.

Interval notation can use parentheses and square brackets, but keep in mind that parentheses and square brackets mean different things. Parentheses are used to indicate that the solution is greater or less than a number, while square brackets indicate that the solution is also equal to a number (in addition to being either greater or less than).

Also keep in mind that infinity and negative infinity are not numbers in the usual sense and cannot be "equal" to another number, so parentheses are used to represent the concept of infinity.

Let’s look at some examples of interval notation to help clarify the rules:

|English |Interval Notation |
|--------------|-------------|
| All numbers between a and b, including a and b \| `[a,b]`$ |
| All numbers between a and b, but not including a or b | \`(a,b)`$ |
| All numbers between a and b, including a \| \`[a,b)`$ |
| All numbers greater than a, but not including a | \`(a, \infty)`$ \|
| All numbers less than b, but not including b | `(-\infty, b)`$ \|
| All numbers greater than a, including a | `[a, \infty)`$ |
| All numbers less than b, including b | `(-\infty,b]`$ |
| All numbers | `(\infty,\infty)`$ |

All numbers between a and b, including a and b: `[a, \infty)`$
All numbers: 																		`(\infty,\infty)`$

## Python Implementation
Python can graph inequalities on a number line with the matplotlib library, just like when we created a number line with matlotlib. Let us explore the code for graphing our two initial inequality examples, x is greater than -1 and x is less than or equal to 2:

```python
# import the parts of the matplotlib library we need
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def  setup(ax):
	"""Set up common parameters for the Axes"""

	# Only show the bottom spine.
	# You can think of a spine as an edge or border.
	ax.spines[['left', 'right', 'top']].set_visible(False)

	# Make the ticks for the y-axis null.
	# This next line of code essentially removes
	# the ticks for the y-axis.
	ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.NullLocator())

	# Make the ticks for the x-axis 1 inch apart.
	ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1))

	# Define the tick styles.
	ax.tick_params(which='major', width=1.00, length=5)

	# Define number line range.
	ax.set_xlim(-3, 3)
	ax.set_ylim(0, 1)

# Create an empty figure with no axes.
# Make the figure 6 inches wide and 4 inches high.
plt.figure(figsize=(6.0, 4.0))

# Add and center an axis inside the image.
# The first parameter is the number of rows.
# The second parameter is the number of columns.
# The third parameter is an index for grid placement.
ax = plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)

# Give that axis the common parameters
# from the setup function.
setup(ax)

# You can create multiple figures by using multiple 
# figure calls with an increasing figure number.
# Start figure 1.
plt.figure(1, figsize=(6.0, 4.0))
ax = plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
setup(ax)

# Create the points on the number line
# for figure 1.
plt.plot([-0.9, 2.9], [0.1, 0.1])
ax.plot(
	-1, 0.1, 
	color='tab:blue', 
	fillstyle='none', 
	marker='o'
)
ax.plot(
	2.9, 0.1, 
	color='tab:blue', 
	marker='>'
)

# Save figure 1 which graphs 
# the inequality "x is greater than -1".
plt.savefig("manuscript/resources/num-line-4.png")

Start figure 2.
plt.figure(2, figsize=(6.0, 4.0))
ax = plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
setup(ax)

# Create the points on the number line
# for figure 2.
plt.plot([-2.9, 1.9], [0.1, 0.1])
ax.plot(2, 0.1, color='tab:blue', marker='o')
ax.plot(-2.9, 0.1, color='tab:blue', marker='<')

# Save figure 2 which graphs 
# the inequality "x is less than or equal to 2".
plt.savefig("manuscript/resources/num-line-5.png")
```

# Absolute Values

|−x| + −|y| when x = −20, y = −14

should be 6

−x In front of a variable, it indicates the opposite. We read −x as “the opposite of x.”  
−(−2) Here there are two “ − ” signs. The one in the parentheses tells us the number is

negative 2. The one outside the parentheses tells us to take the opposite of −2.

We read −(−2) as “the opposite of negative two.”

  

The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.

The absolute value of a number n is written as |n|

  

n| ≥ 0 for all numbers

Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero!

  

x = -20

y = -14

print(abs(-(-x)) + (-abs(y)))

# Expected output: 6

The absolute value of a number is the distance of that number from zero on the number line. The absolute value of a number is always a non-negative value, meaning it is either zero or a positive number.

For example, the absolute value of 5 is 5 because 5 units away from zero on the number line in the positive direction. The absolute value of -5 is also 5 because -5 units away from zero on the number line in the negative direction.

The symbol used to represent absolute value is vertical bars, | |. For example, |5| represents the absolute value of 5, and |-5| represents the absolute value of -5.

In mathematical equations or expressions, we often use absolute values to ensure that we are only working with positive numbers. For instance, if we have an equation that contains a variable that can be either positive or negative, we can use absolute values to ensure that the final answer is positive.

Here are the steps to find the absolute value of a number:

1.  Write down the number whose absolute value you want to find.
    
2.  If the number is positive, then its absolute value is simply the same as the number itself. For example, the absolute value of 5 is 5.
    
3.  If the number is negative, then its absolute value is the opposite of the number, without the negative sign. For example, the absolute value of -5 is 5.
    
4.  You can use the absolute value notation (vertical bars) to express the result. For example, |5| = 5 and |-5| = 5.
    

In summary, the absolute value of a number is always positive, and it is obtained by removing any negative sign from a negative number, or leaving a positive number unchanged.

# Distance Between Two Points

We often want to look at two points on the number line and determine the distance between them.

Whenever we want to find the distance between two numbers, we always subtract the smaller number from the larger.

To find the distance between two points on a number line, you can follow these steps:

1.  Identify the two points on the number line.
    
2.  Determine which point has the larger value and which has the smaller value. Let's call the larger value "point B" and the smaller value "point A".
    
3.  Subtract the value of point A from the value of point B. This will give you the distance between the two points as a positive number, regardless of which point is larger.
    

So the formula to find the distance between two points A and B on a number line is:

Distance = |B - A|

where "|" denotes the absolute value.

# Rounding Decimals

To round decimals, you can follow these steps:

1.  Identify the place value you want to round to. For example, if you want to round to the nearest tenth, you would look at the digit in the tenths place.
    
2.  Look at the digit to the right of the place value you want to round to. If this digit is 5 or greater, then you will need to round up. If this digit is less than 5, then you will round down.
    
3.  If you need to round up, increase the digit in the place value you are rounding to by 1. For example, if you are rounding 4.56 to the nearest tenth, you would round up to 4.6.
    
4.  If you need to round down, leave the digit in the place value you are rounding to as it is. For example, if you are rounding 4.43 to the nearest tenth, you would round down to 4.4.
    
5.  If the digit to the right of the place value you are rounding to is exactly 5, then you will need to look at the digit in the place value you are rounding from. If this digit is odd, round up. If this digit is even, round down. For example, if you are rounding 3.75 to the nearest whole number, you would look at the digit in the tenths place, which is 5. The digit in the ones place is 7, which is odd, so you would round up to 4.
    

In summary, rounding decimals involves determining the place value to round to, examining the digit to the right of that place value, and making a decision whether to round up or down based on that digit and potentially the digit in the place value being rounded from.

Here's an example of rounding decimals:

Let's say you have the decimal number 3.456 and you want to round it to the nearest hundredth.

1.  Identify the place value you want to round to, which is the hundredths place (the second digit to the right of the decimal point).
    
2.  Look at the digit to the right of the hundredths place, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, you will need to round up.
    
3.  Increase the digit in the hundredths place by 1, which gives you 3.46.
    

Therefore, 3.456 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 3.46.

Another example:

Let's say you have the decimal number 7.8935 and you want to round it to the nearest thousandth.

1.  Identify the place value you want to round to, which is the thousandths place (the fourth digit to the right of the decimal point).
    
2.  Look at the digit to the right of the thousandths place, which is 5. Since 5 is equal to 5, you will need to look at the digit in the thousandths place.
    
3.  The digit in the thousandths place is 3, which is odd. Therefore, you will need to round up.
    
4.  Increase the digit in the thousandths place by 1, which gives you 7.894.
    

Therefore, 7.8935 rounded to the nearest thousandth is 7.894.

# Ordering Decimal Numbers

To order decimal numbers means to arrange them in increasing or decreasing order from the smallest to the largest, or from the largest to the smallest.

When ordering decimal numbers, you need to compare the values of each digit to determine which number is greater or smaller. Start by comparing the leftmost digit, and then move on to the next digit to the right if necessary. If the leftmost digits of two decimal numbers are the same, then compare the next digit to the right until a difference is found.

For example, let's say you have the following decimal numbers: 2.45, 3.1, 1.98, 2.4, and 3.02. To order these numbers from the smallest to the largest, you would start by comparing the leftmost digit of each number:

-   1.98
    
-   2.4
    
-   2.45
    
-   3.02
    
-   3.1
    

In this case, the decimal numbers are now in ascending order from the smallest (1.98) to the largest (3.1).

If you need to order decimal numbers from the largest to the smallest, you can use the same process but compare the digits in the reverse order. In the example above, the decimal numbers ordered from largest to smallest would be:

-   3.1
    
-   3.02
    
-   2.45
    
-   2.4
    
-   1.98
    

In summary, to order decimal numbers, compare the digits of each number starting from the left and move to the right as needed.

In Python, you can use the built-in sorted() function to order decimal numbers in ascending or descending order. Here's an example:

python

# Create a list of decimal numbers

decimals = [3.14, 2.71, 1.618, 4.20, 0.123]

  

# Sort the list in ascending order

sorted_decimals = sorted(decimals)

print(sorted_decimals) # Output: [0.123, 1.618, 2.71, 3.14, 4.2]

  

# Sort the list in descending order

sorted_decimals_desc = sorted(decimals, reverse=True)

print(sorted_decimals_desc) # Output: [4.2, 3.14, 2.71, 1.618, 0.123]

  

In the example above, we created a list of decimal numbers and used the sorted() function to order them in ascending order by default. We then used the reverse parameter of the sorted() function to sort the list in descending order. Note that the original list decimals remains unchanged, and the sorted lists are assigned to new variables sorted_decimals and sorted_decimals_desc.

If you have a list of strings that represent decimal numbers, you can convert them to floats first before sorting them. Here's an example:

python

# Create a list of decimal numbers as strings

decimals_str = ['3.14', '2.71', '1.618', '4.20', '0.123']

  

# Convert the strings to floats and sort the list in ascending order

sorted_decimals = sorted([float(d) for d in decimals_str])

print(sorted_decimals) # Output: [0.123, 1.618, 2.71, 3.14, 4.2]

  

In this example, we used a list comprehension to convert each string in the decimals_str list to a float, and then sorted the resulting list in ascending order using the sorted() function.

Negative exponents

-   Book says: “When any number, except 0, has a negative exponent, take the reciprocal of the number with its opposite exponent”
    
-   Openstax says: “The negative exponent tells us we can rewrite the expression by taking the reciprocal of the base and then changing the sign of the exponent.”
    
-   Khan says “negative traditionally means the opposite of…”. That is why negative means opposite of multiplication, which is division…. hmm.
    
-   All three state the rule as: a-n =1an
    
-   I probably need to cover reciprocals first
